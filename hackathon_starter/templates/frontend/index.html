                Welcome to openstay, this is an open source hostshareing service.
                It was an idea brought about with the mass abouts of social marketplaces to pop up.
                
                The idea behind this is everyone listed on here is volunteering their 
                space and time in exchange for yours when they come visit you.
            
                Keeping in terms with the honor system. OpenStay is a listing service not a marketplace.
                This means that no money exchanges on OpenStay
               <br/>
